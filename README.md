# Automobile_Tier_prediction
In this repository we try to predict the product tier from the details of an automobile.

Some key observations and the approaches used in the work:

Significant class imbalance in the dataset.
Used SMOTE to oversample the minority class data points.
Used Logistic regression and Random Forest for initial modeling.
Used Grid search with kfold cross-validation for model selection(fine-tuning).  
Created some new features from the existing features.
Implemented a deep learning approach to the model along with the implementation of dataset class and basic ANN.
